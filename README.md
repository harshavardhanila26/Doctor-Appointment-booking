ü©∫ Doctor Appointment System
This project is a web-based platform designed to efficiently manage the entire lifecycle of medical appointments. It serves as a central hub connecting patients with doctors, providing a seamless experience from booking to follow-up. The system operates with two distinct user roles: patients and doctors, each with a tailored dashboard to manage their specific tasks. Upon logging in, the system intelligently redirects users to their respective dashboards. All user data and appointments are securely stored and managed in a MySQL database.
